# Debugging Instructions

I have added detailed logging to captured the "ai generation failed" error.

1.  Please **try to generate problems again** from the UI.
2.  Once the error occurs, let me know (or check `debug_generation.log` yourself).
3.  I will then analyze the `debug_generation.log` file to find the root cause.
